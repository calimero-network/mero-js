# Download a released Calimero 1.0 merod for linux-x86_64 into ./merod, with the
# release's kv-store test fixture as ./kv_store.wasm, for the cluster tests
# (`pnpm test:cloud-v2` with MEROD_BINARY and KV_STORE_WASM).
#
# Only releases of one major line are considered (MEROD_LINE, default 1): the
# 0.x releases are v1 nodes, which the 1.0 client cannot talk to, and a future
# 2.0 should be a deliberate move, not whatever happens to be newest. Prereleases
# count (1.0.0-rc.1 is the first 1.0 release). MEROD_TAG names one release
# instead.
#
# Walks back through the line's releases rather than taking only the newest:
# GitHub publishes a release object before its binary matrix finishes uploading,
# so the newest tag can carry no merod yet while the one before it is usable.
#
# The binary is checked against the release's SHA256SUMS. The fixture is not
# listed there; its app.wasm is checked against the digest its signed manifest
# names.
