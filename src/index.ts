// Mero.js: the JavaScript client for Calimero 1.0, the confidential cloud.
//
// `CalimeroClient` verifies a node's TDX attestation, seals every request to
// it, and signs people in with passkeys and machines with API keys; its
// groups (`client.orgs.get({ org })`, ...) are every route of the node,
// generated from core's OpenAPI document. Everything below it is the pieces it
// is built from, exported for callers who need one on its own. The layering
// (runtime/ → generated/ + routes/ → client/) is described in
// src/routes/index.ts.

// The client, its errors and its types
export * from './client/index.js';

// The node's routes as generated methods (`createRoutes`), the passkey answer
// to a step-up (`passkeyConfirm`), and names for the document's types.
export * from './routes/index.js';

// The runtime the client sends every route through (also its own entry point,
// `@calimero-network/mero-js/runtime`): one `Transport.request` over the
// attested, sealed channel, with the session, step-up and error mapping.
