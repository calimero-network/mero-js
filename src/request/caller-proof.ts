/**
 * Assemble the credential a node reads from `X-Calimero-Proof`.
 *
 * A request-carried proof is three links, and the node needs all of them in one
 * header: the account root certified the device, the device (optionally)
 * certified a short-lived session key, and that key signed THIS request. Each
 * link is minted by its own function here — {@link signDeviceCert},
 * {@link signLoginStatement}, {@link signRequest} — and each already returns
 * the borsh encoding of the Rust type the node deserializes. Rust's
 * `CallerProof` is a plain struct of those three fields, and borsh writes a
 * struct as its fields back to back, so assembling the header is concatenation
 * rather than a fourth encoder.
 *
 * That is worth stating because it is load-bearing and it is not obvious: if it
 * were re-encoded here there would be a second spelling of a signed structure,
 * able to disagree with the one that was signed. `caller-proof.test.ts` pins the
 * concatenation against bytes produced by core itself.
