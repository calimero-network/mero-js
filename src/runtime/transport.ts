 * Everything else is here, behind one call, {@link Transport.request}:
 *
 * - the sealed channel to each node, opened only after the node's attestation
 *   passed the caller's policy (`../sealed`, `./attestation`);
 * - the credential (an API key or a session), and the session's refresh when a
 *   node answers `401` to it;
 * - moving to another node of the cluster on `421 WRONG_NODE`, and failing
 *   over when one stays unavailable to a call or a view (D70 retries);
 * - the `412 CONFIRM_REQUIRED` step-up: the passkey's assertion over the
 *   node's challenge, sent with the same body again;
 * - error mapping (a refusal is a typed {@link CalimeroError}) and
 *   server-sent event decoding.
 *
 * Paths are relative to the node (`apps/{app}/intents`, a leading `/` is
