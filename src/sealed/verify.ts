/**
 * Verifying a TEE node's quote in the page, before trusting the key it binds.
 *
 * A quote proves what runs in a TD only once it has been checked: its
 * signatures against Intel's root, the TCB status of the platform, the
 * measurements of the image, and that its report data is the nonce and the
 * binding this client asked for. {@link createQuoteVerifier} does all of that
 * here, with nothing but the node: the node hands over the Intel-signed
 * collateral with its quote (`includeCollateral`), and a node cannot forge
 * collateral, only choose which valid collateral to serve.
 *
 * The DCAP verification itself — parsing the quote, checking its signature
 * chain and appraising its TCB level against the collateral — comes from a
 * library you pass in, normally `verify` from `@phala/dcap-qvl`, a pure
 * JavaScript implementation that runs in browsers, Node and React Native. It
 * is passed in rather than bundled so this SDK keeps no runtime dependencies,
 * and applications that never talk to a TEE node pay nothing for it.
