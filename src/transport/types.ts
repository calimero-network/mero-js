/**
 * One call shape, two ways of getting there.
 *
 * # Why the node shape is the canonical one
 *
 * `RpcClient.execute({ contextId, method, argsJson })` is what every app in the
 * fleet already writes, and `RelayClient.execute(contextId, method, argsJson)`
 * is what the delegated path grew independently. They differ in *both* halves —
 * positional vs. named arguments, and `T` vs. `IntentResult<T>`. A caller that
 * wanted to switch transports therefore had to rewrite every call site, which
 * makes the transport a property of the application rather than of the
 * connection.
 *
 * This interface closes that by declaring the node's shape the contract and
 * adapting the relay to it. The direction is deliberate and not symmetric:
 * shipped code uses the node shape, so any other choice would be a breaking
 * change dressed up as an abstraction.
 *
 * # Why subscription is not a method on this interface
 *
 * Not because a relay cannot be observed — it can; a relay is an ordinary node
 * and a keyholder can log in to it (see `./relay-observer.ts`). It is because
 * `RpcClient` satisfies this interface *as it already ships*, and `RpcClient`
 * has never had a `subscribe`. Adding one would change the canonical shape,
 * which is the single thing this work must not do.
 *
 * Observation therefore lives on `MeroClient` — `client.events`, `client.ws` —
 * where it lives for a node client, and is the same call on both transports.
 * {@link ExecuteTransport.canSubscribe} reports whether it will work, so an app
 * can branch on data rather than on a thrown error.
