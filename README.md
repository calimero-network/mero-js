# Mero.js — the JavaScript client for Calimero 1.0

The JavaScript/TypeScript client for [Calimero](https://calimero-network.github.io/core/)
1.0, the confidential cloud. `CalimeroClient` verifies a node's TDX attestation,
seals every request to it end to end (Noise NK, `calimero/sealed-http/v2`), signs
people in with WebAuthn passkeys and machines with API keys, and calls apps that
each run on their own replicated log. It runs in the browser and Node 18+, and is
byte-compatible with core's `calimero-sealed` and `calimero-client`.

> **Version 27 is the Calimero 1.0 client only.** The v1 SDK for merod 0.x nodes
> (`MeroJs`, the admin and auth API clients, JSON-RPC, contexts and namespaces)
> is in 26.x. See [Migrating from v1](https://calimero-network.github.io/mero-js/reference/migrating-from-v1/).

> **Before committing, titling a pull request, or releasing**, read [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md): the PR title is the release commit, and the rules are shared by every Calimero repository that ships releases.

## Documentation

**<https://calimero-network.github.io/mero-js/>**: quickstart, guides, and the
reference for every method and the route it calls. The source is under [`docs/`](docs/).

## Installation

```bash
npm install @calimero-network/mero-js
```

The package ships ESM, CommonJS and a minified browser build with its own
TypeScript declarations. Its one dependency, `@phala/dcap-qvl`, verifies TDX
quotes and is loaded on first use.

## Quick start

```ts
import { CalimeroClient, browserPasskey, passkeyConfirm } from '@calimero-network/mero-js';

// Reach a Calimero Cloud cluster by name.
const client = await CalimeroClient.connect({
  cluster: 'eu-shared-1',
  // Trust the signed mero-tee release the node names, from this one up.
  policy: { release: { minReleaseVersion: '2.3.109' } },
});

await client.signUp(browserPasskey(), 'alice'); // or signIn(browserPasskey())
await client.packages.install({ package: 'com.example.kv', version: '1.0.0' }); // signed .mpk from the registry
const { appId: app } = await client.apps.create({ name: 'kv', package: 'com.example.kv', version: '1.0.0' });

await client.apps.call({ app, method: 'set', args: { key: 'a', value: '1' } });
const { result } = await client.apps.view({ app, method: 'get', args: { key: 'a' } });
await client.apps.call({ app, method: 'clear', args: {} }, { confirm: passkeyConfirm(browserPasskey()) }); // passkey consent
for await (const event of client.events(app)) console.log(event);
await client.apps.upgrade({ app, version: '1.1.0' }, { confirm: passkeyConfirm(browserPasskey()) }); // the owner approves
```

A development cluster (`merod local`, `merod run --dev`) sends mock quotes,
which pass only with `policy: { allowMock: true }`. Nothing is read from the
environment.

## Connecting to a cluster

`CalimeroClient.connect({ cluster, policy })` is the recommended way to reach a
Calimero Cloud cluster. It reads the cluster's nodes from the public node
directory (`DEFAULT_DIRECTORY`, `https://manager.cloud.calimero.network/api/v2/directory`;
`directory` names another), puts those in `zone` first when you give one, and
orders each group at random, weighted by the directory's weight. A cluster the
directory does not know, or one with no usable node, throws `DirectoryError`.

The directory only picks which nodes to try, and in what order. It is not
trusted: every node is attested under **your** `policy` before anything is
sent to it, so a wrong or tampered list can only make connecting fail.

Any node of a cluster serves any request. While the node in use answers `503`
or cannot be reached, a call or a view is retried there (`retry`); when those
retries run out it fails over to the next node and starts them again there,
with the **same** idempotency key, which the app's replicated log answers once
cluster-wide. Each node is tried once per request; when all have failed, the
last `UnavailableError` reaches you. After a failover, and once the directory's
`refreshAfterSeconds` has passed (checked at the next request), the client
reads the directory again in the background: the node in use stays first,
nodes no longer listed are dropped. `client.nodeUrl` is the node in use,
`client.nodes` the list.

For a fixed list of nodes or a cluster you run yourself, construct the client
directly: `new CalimeroClient({ baseUrl, nodes, policy })`. It fails over
between `baseUrl` and `nodes` the same way, and never reads a directory.

## What the client checks

Before it sends anything to a node, as core's Rust client does (`Measurements::Release`):

1. The node names the mero-tee release it runs. A release below `minReleaseVersion` is refused before anything is fetched.
2. The release's `published-mrtds.json` is fetched and its Sigstore signature is checked against the mero-tee node release workflow.
   By default it comes from the `cloud.calimero.network` mirror; `releaseSource: 'github'` reads the GitHub release instead (Node only: GitHub sends no CORS headers).
3. The quote is checked against Intel's collateral with `@phala/dcap-qvl`: the signature chain and the TCB status. The collateral comes from the cloud's mirror (`DEFAULT_COLLATERAL_MIRROR`), which browsers can read; it only carries Intel-signed items. `collateralSource: 'intel'` asks Intel's PCS (no CORS: not in browsers), `fetchCollateral` replaces the fetch, and `maxCollateralAgeDays` refuses collateral Intel issued longer ago.
4. A debug TD is refused.
5. The registers must be the release's `locked-read-only` image; a debug profile is trusted only with `allowDebugProfile`.
6. The quote's report data binds the client's nonce and the transport key the sealed channel opens to.

Pinned measurements go through `policy.verifyQuote` (`createQuoteVerifier`).

## The API

Every route of the node is a generated method, in a group per area
(`client.apps`, `client.auth`, `client.orgs`, `client.packages`,
`client.deployments`, `client.consent`, `client.ops`, `client.public`); see
[below](#the-runtime-and-the-route-layer). The hand-written methods left are the
flows and streams a single route cannot be:

- **Credentials**: `signUp(passkey, name, { invite?, origin?, signal? })`, `signIn(passkey, { origin?, signal? })`, `refresh`, `signOut`, `signOutEverywhere`, `useSession`, `useApiKey`, `addPasskey(newPasskey, approver)`.
- **Account recovery** (core #4844): signed out, `startAccountRecovery(code, passkey)` and, 72 hours later, `finishAccountRecovery(passkey, accountId?)`. The code itself is `client.auth.recoveryCreate({}, { confirm })`.
- **Organization recovery**: `startRecovery(org, seed)` (the seed signs here and never leaves the process); `newRecoverySeed`, `recoveryPublicKey`.
- **Blobs**: `downloadBlob(app, id)`, `downloadBlobGranted(app, id, grant)` (bytes; `client.apps.blobDownload` answers a `Blob` with its type).
- **Streams**: `events(app, from?, signal?)`, `presenceStream(app, signal?)`.
- **Approvals from an app**: `pendingApprovals(org?)`, `appsReportAll(org)`, then `openConsentPage(request, …)` to send the user to the node's consent page, and `waitForConsent(requestId)`; back on `returnTo`, `resumeConsent()` reads the decision on the request this page started from the node (never from the URL) and refuses a return for another request or one still pending. Besides releases, upgrades and outbound hosts, `createOrgConsent`, `createInviteConsent` and `acceptInviteConsent` ask for a new organization, an invite or joining with one; the result's `outcome` (`{ orgId }`, `{ token }`, `{ org }`) is typed by `kind`. Show the answer's `code` to the user before sending them to `url` (`openConsentPage`'s `confirm` hook); they should see the same code on the page (`confirmationCode(requestId)` checks it). See [Ask your users to approve node images and app upgrades](https://calimero-network.github.io/mero-js/guides/user-approvals/).

Refusals are typed (`LoginRequired`, `PasskeyUnknownHere`, `WrongNode`, `NotFound`, `ConfirmRequired`, `ConfirmCancelled`, `ConfirmPromptBlocked`,
`ArgsTooLarge`, `IdempotencyMismatch`, `ReleaseDeadlineError`, `RuntimeTooOld`, `ConsentStale`, `AppError`, `TrapError`,
`UnavailableError`, `OriginNotRegistered`, `BadOrigin`, `OriginTaken`, `QuotaExceeded`),
all extending `CalimeroError` with the node's `status` and `code`. A `401` once
the node that issued the session is replaced or out of reach is answered by one
refresh and a repeat; a `421 WRONG_NODE` by moving to the next of the `nodes` the client was
given. See the
[error model](https://calimero-network.github.io/mero-js/reference/error-model/).

The pieces it is built from are exported too: the sealed transport
(`createSealedFetch`), quote and signed-release verification
(`createQuoteVerifier`, `createSignedReleaseVerifier`, `trustSignedRelease`), and
the client for mero-tee's private agent gate (`attestAgent`, `provisionAgent`,
`releaseAgent`).

## The runtime and the route layer

The client is two layers. The **runtime** (`@calimero-network/mero-js/runtime`,
`src/runtime/`) is everything that is not a route: the node's attestation, the
sealed channel, the credential and the session's refresh on a `401`, moving on
`421 WRONG_NODE`, D70 retries and failover, error mapping and server-sent
events. The **route layer** is generated from core's OpenAPI document
(`openapi/core-openapi.json`, the node's `docs/public/openapi.json`) by
`pnpm gen:api`: `openapi-typescript` writes the types (`src/generated/api.ts`)
and `scripts/gen-methods.mjs` one method per operation
(`src/generated/methods.ts`), grouped by the operation's tag. `CalimeroClient`
exposes the groups, which share `client.transport`'s session:

```ts
import { passkeyConfirm } from '@calimero-network/mero-js';

const org = await client.orgs.get({ org: orgId });             // the typed payload
const { result } = await client.apps.call({ app, method: 'set', args: { key: 'a' } });
const { token } = await client.orgs.inviteCreate(               // a step-up (412)
  { org: orgId, role: 'member' },
  { confirm: passkeyConfirm(passkey) },
);
await client.apps.blobUpload({ app, body: bytes, contentType: 'image/png' });
```

- **Groups**: `client.apps`, `client.auth`, `client.orgs`, `client.packages`,
  `client.deployments`, `client.consent`, `client.ops`, `client.public`.
- **One argument object**: path parameters, query parameters and body fields
  merged, all typed from the document. The body goes whole under `body` when it is
  raw bytes (with an optional `contentType`) or when its field names would collide.
  A route whose query parameter is named like a path parameter takes its query
  under `query`.
- **The answer** is the route's typed success payload (a `Blob` for a download).
  A refusal is thrown as the typed `CalimeroError` (`NotFound`, `ConfirmRequired`, ...).
- **Challenges**: the second argument `{ confirm?, operatorProof?, signal? }`
  answers this call's `412 CONFIRM_REQUIRED` (`passkeyConfirm(passkey)`) or
  `428 OPERATOR_SIGNATURE_REQUIRED` (the operator key's signature over the
  statement). The client's own `new CalimeroClient(options, { confirm, operatorProof })`
  answers every call that gives none.
- **Retries**: a route the document marks `x-calimero-retry-safe` (a call, a
  view, a method by its path) is sent again on a `503` as D70 says; one whose
  retries require an `idempotencyKey` gets one when it has none, which its retries
  and its confirmed retry share. A `421 WRONG_NODE` moves to the next node.
- **Step-ups** ask the passkey for the route's own user verification
  (`x-calimero-user-verification`: `preferred` for the sign-up's confirmation,
  `required` elsewhere).
- **Streams** (`events`, `presenceStream`) stay hand-written on the runtime.
- `createRoutes(createRouteClient(transport, { confirm, operatorProof }))` builds
  the same groups on any `NodeTransport`. The route client under them sends each
  request through the transport (sealed, with the credential; `/attestation` and
  `/health` in the clear); write against the groups, not against it.

The single-route methods of 29.x (`createOrg`, `call`, ...) are gone; see
[Upgrading from 29.x](#upgrading-from-29x). The ceremonies (`signUp`, `signIn`, `addPasskey`,
account and organization recovery, `openConsentPage`, ...) stay as flows.

The runtime's own surface toward routes is still one interface, for a route
layer of your own:

```ts
interface Transport {
  request(method: HttpMethod, path: string, options?: RequestOptions): Promise<Response>; // 2xx, body unread
  json<T>(method: HttpMethod, path: string, options?: RequestOptions): Promise<T>;
  events(path: string, options?: { query?; signal? }): AsyncGenerator<NodeEvent>;
}
// RequestOptions: { query?, body? (JSON) | bytes? + contentType?, passkey? (answers a 412),
//                   userVerification?, retry?: true | 'once' (D70), signal?, promptSignal? }
```

`NodeTransport` implements it, and `exchange(method, path, options)` answers a
refusal as the node's response instead of throwing it (what the generated
client sends through). The `/runtime` entry re-exports the package's own bundle,
so its error classes are the ones `CalimeroClient` throws (`instanceof` holds
across both imports).

### Refreshing the OpenAPI document

`openapi/core-openapi.json` is vendored from core at the commit `openapi/SOURCE`
names. `scripts/refresh-openapi.sh [<core ref>]` (`pnpm refresh:openapi`)
fetches it again, records the commit and regenerates `src/generated/`;
`pnpm check:api` fails when the generated types or methods are not those of the
vendored document.

`.github/workflows/openapi-sync.yml` does this on its own: core sends a
`repository_dispatch` (`core-openapi`, with the core commit) whenever its
document changes, and a weekly run catches a missed one (or run it by hand with a
`ref`). When the document or the generated code changed, it opens or refreshes a
pull request on `chore/core-openapi` that lists the generated methods added,
removed or changed (`scripts/openapi-sync-summary.mjs`); a removed or renamed
one needs a major release.

It opens that pull request with a GitHub App's token, so the pull request's CI
runs: the organization's shared `vars.ACTIONS_APP_ID` /
`secrets.ACTIONS_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`, which must be shared with this repository. The
app must be installed on this repository
with contents and pull-requests write.

## Upgrading from 29.x

30.0 removes the single-route methods 29.x deprecated, and the untyped `get`,
`post`, `put`, `delete`, `postConfirmed` and `deleteConfirmed`. Each is a
generated method now, which takes one argument object and answers the route's
payload (pick the field the old method answered: `(await client.orgs.create({
name })).orgId`). A step-up takes `{ confirm: passkeyConfirm(passkey) }` as the
second argument. `client.packages` and `client.deployments` are groups, no longer
callable (`(await client.packages.list()).packages`).

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm test:unit   # unit tests, against a stand-in node over a real sealed channel
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm typecheck:consumer
```

The cluster tests (`tests/cluster`) start three `merod run --dev` nodes and
run the client against them:

```bash
MEROD_BINARY=/path/to/merod KV_STORE_WASM=/path/to/kv_store.wasm pnpm test:cluster
```

Without the variables they use `../core/target/debug/merod` and
`../core/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/app-release/kv_store.wasm` from a sibling
core checkout. `scripts/download-released-merod.sh` fetches the newest released
1.0 `merod` and its kv-store fixture, which is what CI runs them against; core's
`e2e.yml` runs the same suite against core's own tree.
